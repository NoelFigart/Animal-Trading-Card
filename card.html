			<p>The Coffee Dragon is the shyest of all of the Dragon species.  Noted for its fine brown scales which help conceal it in a cup of coffee, the Coffee Dragon is not a hoarding species.  Instead, it gains its nourishment and strength from the strength of the coffee brew.  Coffee dragons who live in homes that regularly serve coffee made in an Ibrik can live as long as 900 years. </p>
